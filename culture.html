                    <h2>Name Evolution</h2>  
                    <p>Qinghai Province is named after Qinghai Lake, the largest inland saltwater lake in China. In ancient times, Qinghai was known by several names, including Western Sea, Xianshuihai, and Beiheqianghai. The Tibetan name for Qinghai is Cuowenbo, and the Mongolian name is Kukunor, all of which refer to the blue-colored lake. During the Western Han period, Qinghai was referred to as Western Sea, derived from the name of the Qiang ethnic group living in the area. Over time, the name evolved, with various dynasties adapting it for use in their maps.</p>  
                    <p>During the reign of Wang Mang, the name “Western Sea” began to be used more as a geographic reference. This shift continued through various periods of Chinese history, until Qinghai became its permanent name in the Northern Wei period.</p>
                    <h2>Historical Evolution</h2>
                   <h3>Pre-Qin Period</h3>
                   <p>As early as tens of thousands of years ago, ancient humans thrived in Qinghai. During the ancient times, the ancestors of the Qiang people migrated from the Jianghan region to Qinghai, living by the waters and practicing hunting and pastoralism. Before the Shang Dynasty, Qinghai was known as the "Three Dangerous Land". In the Xia Dynasty, the residents of the Hehuang region were called the Western Qiang, who were primarily engaged in animal husbandry, with the early stages of agriculture using oxen and horses. By the Western Zhou period, the local people had mastered the production of bronze weapons such as halberds and arrowheads, and made significant advances in agriculture and animal husbandry.</p>
                   <p>During the Warring States period, the influence of Central Plains culture prompted the Qiang people of the Hehuang region to shift from hunting and herding to agriculture. As agriculture developed, more tribes began to join this area, with the Qiang society implementing a hereditary leadership system.</p>
                   <h3>Qin, Han to Northern and Southern Dynasties</h3>
                   <p>During the Qin Dynasty, the Qinghai region experienced relative stability, providing favorable conditions for the growth of the Qiang population. Trade during this time was primarily based on bartering, with cattle playing an important role in trade. The introduction of copper smelting technology led to improvements in local production tools and daily items, promoting the development of handicrafts.</p>
                   <p>During the Western Han period, Qinghai was under the jurisdiction of Jincheng Commandery, with areas like Haowei, Poqiang, Anyi, and Linqiang counties, all within the Huangshui valley. Emperor Wu of Han expanded the Han Empire to the west, recovering the Hexi Corridor and restoring trade routes between Central and Western China. In 111 BC, General Li Xi and Langzhong Ling Xu Ziwei led forces into the Huangshui region and set up a military defense system.</p>
                   <p>In the year 61 BC, General Zhao Chongguo pacified the Qiang people’s border disputes and implemented the Tuntian system, establishing seven counties. As more Han Chinese people migrated to the area for farming, the mixing of Han and Qiang cultures further propelled the development of agriculture in the region. In the late Western Han period, Wang Mang set up the Western Sea Commandery in the present-day area of Sanjiao City, marking the formal integration of the eastern Qinghai region into the Chinese feudal administrative system.</p>
                   <h3>After the Establishment of the People's Republic of China</h3>
                   <p>On January 1, 1950, the Qinghai Provincial People's Government was formally established, with Xining as the capital. From 1953 to 1954, various Tibetan autonomous regions were formed, later renamed autonomous prefectures. From 1966 to 1976, during China's "Third Front" construction period, Qinghai became a key region for national development, significantly boosting urban growth.</p>
