                    <p>Qinghai Lake, located in the northeastern part of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, spans across the counties of Haian, Gangcha, and Gonghe in the Haibei and Hainan Tibetan Autonomous Prefectures. The lake is 106 km long from east to west, 63 km wide from north to south, and its perimeter is about 360 km. Qinghai Lake is the largest inland saltwater lake in China, covering an area of 4,625.6 square kilometers with a water volume of 74.3 billion cubic meters. In December 2024, monitoring data showed that the area of Qinghai Lake has expanded to 4,650.08 square kilometers, 28.1 square kilometers more than the previous year. Qinghai Lake is one of the highest lakes in the world, with a surface elevation of 3,196 meters. The basin is an enclosed inland basin, tilted from northwest to southeast, and has a continental plateau climate. The water of Qinghai Lake is brackish with a high mineralization degree, mainly replenished by river water, with additional sources from spring water and precipitation.</p>
                   
                    <p>Qinghai Lake is part of the Tibetan cultural region, sharing the common features of Tibetan culture such as ethnic customs and cultural heritage, while also having its unique water culture. The Qinghai Lake area is an important base for animal husbandry in Qinghai Province, with significant developments in agriculture, tourism, and industrial production. The region's economy mainly relies on the secondary industry, with the primary industry playing a supportive role. The tertiary industry is concentrated along the lakeside highway. Qinghai Lake is a typical example of a plateau inland lake wetland, an important breeding and migratory site for waterfowl, and a crucial water conservation and atmospheric circulation hub in western China, maintaining the ecological security of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau and acting as a natural barrier against desertification in the west.</p>
                    <h3>Formation and Evolution</h3>
                    <p>The initial development of the Qinghai Lake Basin dates back to the Paleozoic era. It was originally part of the Gonghe Basin, forming a rhomboid fault depression basin. In the early Mesozoic, the basin's center rose due to northwestward faulting, gradually forming the Qinghai Southern Mountains, dividing the basin into the Gonghe Basin and the Qinghai Lake Basin. Since the Cenozoic era, with the noticeable uplift of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, faults formed several different-sized uplift zones. In the early to middle Jurassic period, the area was already land, and the crust was stable, undergoing long-term erosion and leveling, forming the oldest peneplain in the region. The basin landscape of Qinghai Lake first appeared in the late Tertiary, as part of the "Qingdong Ancient Lake." During the early to middle Quaternary, the Qinghai Lake Basin began to sink, with river mouths elevating.</p>
                    <p>Approximately 200,000–2 million years ago, in the early lake formation period, Qinghai Lake was an outflow freshwater lake connected to the Yellow River system. The Buha River passed through Qinghai Lake and entered the Guede Basin, eventually merging with the Yellow River. Around 130,000 years ago, due to tectonic movements, the surrounding mountains rose sharply. In the late Pliocene, the Sun Moon Mountain in the eastern part of the lake area began to rise, blocking the previous outflowing river, causing the lake to change into a closed basin, forming smaller lakes such as Gaohai, Erhai, and later Haiyan Lake and Shadao Lake.</p>
                    <h3>Regional Scope</h3>
                    <p>Qinghai Lake is located in the northeastern part of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, spanning across Haibei and Hainan Tibetan Autonomous Prefectures' Haiyan, Gangcha, and Gonghe counties. It lies between 99°36′–100°16′E and 36°32′–37°15′N. The lake is surrounded by four mountains: the Datong Mountain to the north, the Sun Moon Mountain to the east, the Qinghai Southern Mountains to the south, and the Xiangpi Mountain to the west. The lake stretches 106 km from east to west, 63 km from north to south, with a perimeter of about 360 km. Qinghai Lake is the largest inland saltwater lake in China, with an area of 4,625.6 square kilometers and a water volume of 74.3 billion cubic meters.</p>
                    <h3>Hydrological Features</h3>
                    <p>The water of Qinghai Lake is mainly replenished by river water, followed by spring water and precipitation. The main rivers that feed the lake each year include the Buha River, Shaliu River, Uha Alang River, and Harge River, contributing 1.612 billion cubic meters annually, accounting for 86% of the total inflow. It is a crucial site for fish migration and a concentration area for birds. The total water input to the lake is 3.493 billion cubic meters, with 1.335 billion cubic meters from rivers, 1.557 billion cubic meters from precipitation, and 401 million cubic meters from groundwater. Due to strong winds and fast evaporation, the lake loses 393 million cubic meters annually through evaporation.</p>
                    <p>Qinghai Lake is a brackish lake with a high mineralization degree of 12.32 g/L and a salt content of 14.13 g/L. The total phosphorus level is low, while oxygen levels in the water are also relatively low, with few planktonic organisms. The water's transparency is high, typically below 3 meters.</p>
                    <p>The water temperature in Qinghai Lake varies with the seasons. In summer, the lake water temperature shows a distinct positive temperature layer, reaching up to 22.3°C in August, with an average of 16°C. The lower layer of water is colder, with an average temperature of 9.5°C and a minimum of 6°C. In autumn, due to frequent winds, the water becomes mixed, and the stratification phenomenon disappears. In winter, the lake surface freezes, creating an inverse temperature layer. In January, the surface water temperature is -0.9°C, while the bottom water temperature is 3.3°C. In spring, after thawing, the surface temperature begins to rise again, gradually returning to summer levels.</p>
